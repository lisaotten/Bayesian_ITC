Start a Bayesin ITC analysis using the exec_itc.py file

Combined Analysis of at least three isotherms is recommended to benefit from joint hierarchical analysis
Example config files for 1:1, 1:2 and heterogeneous binding available in directory
Example synthetic isotherms for 1:1 and 1:2 binding in directory isotherms

Tips for running:
- more complex models or larger datasets may require a greater number of effective walkers to ensure convergence
- there are different options available to model concentrations priors. The options are detailed in the config file.
